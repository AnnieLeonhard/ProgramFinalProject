Teacher's explanation ->

You have to firstly create department and then people like teachers, students
If there are no people, ask user to load department first by message

question with department_id in student: adding a student from the file given
to a appropriate department
we split the info from a file to 4 different objects and put them in
arraylist
String s = line.split(;);
s[0] = id
s[1] = name
s[2] = age
s[3] = department.id

1 method for adding a student to department
finding a student in the deptList -> studentList of specific department,
which is found by id
loop creating a student
for(depart d: deptList){ d is the department name
if(d.getId()==s[3]){ if we find department with the same id as student depId
-> s[3],then we add the student to the student list of the department.
d.stdList.add(new Student(s[0], s[1], s[2]);
}
}

this method is more general than the last one. use either this either the
other one
assigning student with department id, what is Arrd?
public boolean assignStudent(ArrayList<Depart>Arrd, Student s , int id
(values from s[3])){
for( Department d: Arrd){
if(d.getId() == id){
d.StudentList.add(s);
return true;
}
return false;
}
}

javafx message
if(assign Student){
Label.setText("Student successfully added"); Label from javafx
}
else {label.setText("Student not added");
}
